== Problem

Manually

** testing, building and deploying applications or
** ensuring code quality (linting, formatting)

is a lot of work and specific steps like testing or formatting can be forgotten.

== Solution (GitHub-Actions)
=== What it is?

GitHub Actions enables you to add Workflows or pipelines to your repository.
These define a sequence of tasks to be executed automatically whenever a certain event occurs,
such as a push to a Git repository or a pull request.

== Concepts
=== Continuous Integration (CI)

Continuous integration validates changes to an application
by building it and running tests against it.
This makes integration easier by checking if the new change is not
breaking the application.

=== Continuous Delivery (CD)

Continuous delivery is an extension to continuous integration.
It adds a step that automatically deploys
an application to a test/staging environment.

=== Continuous Deployment (CD)

Continuous deployment is an extension to continuous delivery.
It adds a step that automatically deploys
an application to a production environment.

== Alternatives

* Jenkins (Open-Source)
** Pro
*** Can be hosted local
*** Jenkins is a highly flexible tool that can be customized to suit specific needs. It supports various plugins and integrations with other tools.
** Con
*** Due to local hosting, disruptions can more easily occur, and scaling is also not as simple
* BitBucket Pipelines
* GitLab CI/CD

=== Why GitHub-Actions

* Pro
** GitHub Actions is fully integrated with GitHub, which makes it easy to set up and use
** GitHub Actions can scale easily to support large and complex workflows
* Con
** GitHub Actions is not as flexible as Jenkins, and some workflows may require workarounds to implement.
** The dependence of GitHub Actions on GitHub itself and the potential for it to become a paid service in the future are potential cons of the tool.

== Example of using GitHub-Actions

In this example a quarkus app with a postgres database
will be tested, built and deployed.

=== Testing the App

[source,yaml]
----
name: build-and-push

on:
  pull_request:
  push:
    branches:
      - main // <1>

jobs:
  tests:
    name: Test
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    // <2>
    services:
      postgres:
        image: postgres:14
        env:
          POSTGRES_USER: app
          POSTGRES_PASSWORD: app
        ports:
          - 5432:5432
        options: >-
          --health-cmd pg_isready
          --health-interval 10s
          --health-timeout 5s
          --health-retries 5

    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository // <3>
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Set up JDK 17 // <4>
        uses: actions/setup-java@v3
        with:
          distribution: 'temurin'
          java-version: '17'
          cache: 'maven'

      - name: Run Tests // <5>
        run: ./mvnw test
----

<1> This job will run when someone pushes to main or a pull_request is updated
<2> This will start a postgres inside a docker container which can be used
for testing our quarkus app.
<3> This will clone the repository
<4> Set up the JDK so the tests can run.
This will also cache the maven packages so they do not need to be downloaded every time.
<5> Run the tests

=== Building and Push

[source,yaml]
----
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository // <1>
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Setup Docker Buildx // <2>
        uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v2

      - name: Login to GHCR // <3>
        uses: docker/login-action@v2
        with:
          registry: ghcr.io
          username: ${{ github.repository_owner }}
          password: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN  }}

      - name: Set up JDK 17 // <4>
        uses: actions/setup-java@v3
        with:
          distribution: 'temurin'
          java-version: '17'
          cache: 'maven'

      - name: Package // <5>
        run: ./mvnw clean package -DskipTests

      - name: Build and push images // <6>
        uses: docker/build-push-action@v3
        with:
          context: ./
          file: ./src/main/docker/Dockerfile.jvm
          push: ${{ github.event_name != 'pull_request' }}
          tags: ${{ env.IMAGE_NAME }}:latest
          platforms: linux/amd64,linux/arm64
          cache-from: type=registry,ref=${{ env.IMAGE_NAME }}:buildcache // <7>
          cache-to: type=registry,ref=${{ env.IMAGE_NAME }}:buildcache,mode=max // <7>
----
<1> Clone the repository
<2> Setup Docker Buildx to use the features by Moby BuildKit builder toolkit
<3> Login to the GitHub Docker Registry to be able to push to it
<4> Set up JDK 17 and cache the maven packages
<5> Package the quarkus app
<6> Build the container and push it
<7> Cache the build so it is faster when rebuilding unchanged steps
